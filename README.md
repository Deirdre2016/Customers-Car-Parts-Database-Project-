# Database-Project
This was a college project.  The aim of the project was to assess the studentâ€™s ability to design and construct a database that can be deployed in a commercial database management system.

The initial phase of the project required the student to design a relational database for a scenario (pick one model) given out in class or a model agreed with me. The business rules of the scenario must be developed and implemented via the database schema and queries as follows:

1. Relational Schema
a. Tables
b. Attributes
c. Primary Keys
d. Foreign Keys
2. Test Data
3. Queries
a. Select
b. Insert
c. Update
d. Delete

The second requirement of the project is to use the database created to demonstrate Codds rules with respect to your individual database. The first 10 rules MUST be demonstrated using SQL including an explanation (rules 11 and 12 do not require SQL).

Marks were awarded for the following:

1. Functionality (Working application)
2. Architecture (Data Model)
3. Complexity
4. Originality / Innovation
5. Completeness
